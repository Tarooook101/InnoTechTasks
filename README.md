## âœ… Task 2: Sum Calculation Console App

**File:** `Program.cs` (first file)

A C# console application that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to _N_ using two methods:

- **Loop Method:** Iterates using a `for` loop
- **Formula Method:** Uses the mathematical formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`

### Highlights:
- Demonstrates performance differences between iterative and mathematical approaches
- Uses `Stopwatch` for measuring execution time
- Includes input validation and user interaction

## âœ… Task 3: String Generation Console App

**File:** `Program.cs` (second file)

A C# console application that generates a string of numbers using two different techniques:

- **StringBuilder Method:** Efficient for large-scale concatenation
- **String Concatenation Method:** Uses the `+=` operator

### Highlights:
- Shows the performance advantage of `StringBuilder`
- Explains string immutability and its impact
- Uses `Stopwatch` for timing and comparison
- Includes input validation and interactive retry option

---

## ðŸ”§ Common Features in Console Apps:
- Clean and formatted output
- User-friendly interaction with retry options
- Execution time comparison using `Stopwatch`
- Proper validation for all user inputs
