Task 2: Sum Calculation Console App (Program.cs - first file)
This console application compares two methods for calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to N:

Loop Method: Uses a simple for-loop to add numbers one by one

Formula Method: Uses the mathematical formula n*(n+1)/2 for instant calculation

The app demonstrates:

How mathematical formulas can be more efficient than iterative approaches

Performance measurement using Stopwatch

User input validation

Task 3: String Generation Console App (Program.cs - second file)
This console application compares two methods for generating a string of numbers:

StringBuilder Method: Uses StringBuilder for efficient string concatenation

Regular Concatenation Method: Uses standard string concatenation with +=

The app demonstrates:

The performance benefits of StringBuilder for multiple string operations

How string immutability affects performance

Comparative timing analysis between the two approaches

Both console apps feature:

User input validation

Performance measurement

Interactive "try again" loops

Clear output formatting
